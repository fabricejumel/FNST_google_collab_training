        "    It is possible to separate the style representation and content representations in a CNN, learnt during a computer vision task (e.g. image recognition task).\n",

        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind this approach is that CNN pretrained on large image datasets develop an intuition of how images and objects in those images look in terms of content and style. The shallow layers of these networks are more concerned with content of the image like shapes and structural details. The deeper layers are good at understanding the texture and style of the image.\n",

After each step, only the transfer network is updated. The weights of the pre-trained feature extractor remain fixed throughout.
